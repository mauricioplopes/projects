# 🧠 Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Projects Repository**! This space gathers a variety of small projects, exercises, and experimental notebooks primarily written in **Python** and spanning across the following fields:

- Machine Learning  
- Optimization  
- Data Science  
- Artificial Intelligence  
- Deep Learning  
- Related areas in applied computing and analytics  

Most of these works are part of academic activities developed during my postgraduate/master’s studies at the **Instituto de Computação – UNICAMP** (Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Brazil).
